# Identicon

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `identicon` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:identicon, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end

execute code with 
  ex -S mix 
  then with the command line write anything inside the argument
  iex> Identicon.main("example")
  
  
 then close the app and write "open + filename.png"
 example:  open example.png
 
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/identicon](https://hexdocs.pm/identicon).
